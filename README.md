Spring Boot Hello World Application
This is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates the basic structure of a Spring Boot project and how to create a simple RESTful endpoint that displays "Hello, World!" when accessed. It also showcases how to connect the application to a database using Testcontainers.

Requirements
To run this application, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Apache Maven
Running the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
Connect to a Database Using Testcontainers
This application uses Testcontainers to spin up a temporary database for testing purposes. By default, it uses PostgreSQL, but you can customize it based on your needs.

Update the application.properties file located in the src/main/resources directory with the following placeholders:

properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://${container.ip}:${container.getMappedPort(5432)}/mydatabase
spring.datasource.username=${container.username}
spring.datasource.password=${container.password}
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
Open the HelloWorldApplicationTests class located in the src/test/java directory. This test class demonstrates how to use Testcontainers to start a PostgreSQL container for testing.

Build and run the test class to execute the application logic and verify the database connectivity.

bash
Copy code
mvn clean test
Running the Application
After successfully connecting to the database, you can now run the application:

In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory.

Build the application using the following command:

Copy code
mvn clean install
After a successful build, start the application by running the following command:

arduino
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Once the application is running, open a web browser and visit http://localhost:8080/. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

Spring Boot AWS Lambda Deployment
This project demonstrates how to deploy a Spring Boot application to AWS Lambda using Terraform. It provides a simple Spring Boot application that can be deployed as a serverless function on AWS Lambda.

Prerequisites
Before deploying the application, make sure you have the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Apache Maven
Terraform installed on your machine
An AWS account with appropriate permissions
Getting Started
To get started with deploying the Spring Boot application to AWS Lambda, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

Build the Spring Boot application using the following command:

shell
Copy code
mvn clean install
Update the terraform.tf file with your AWS credentials. Replace the placeholders <AWS_ACCESS_KEY> and <AWS_SECRET_KEY> with your AWS access key and secret key, respectively.

Update the Terraform script (main.tf) with the desired AWS region (provider "aws" { region = "us-east-1" }) and other configuration parameters as needed.

Initialize the Terraform project by running the following command:

shell
Copy code
terraform init
Deploy the Spring Boot application to AWS Lambda by executing the following command:

shell
Copy code
terraform apply
Terraform will prompt for confirmation. Type yes to proceed with the deployment.

Once the deployment is complete, Terraform will display the output, including the AWS Lambda function ARN. Make a note of this ARN for future reference.

Access the deployed AWS Lambda function by invoking it with the appropriate payload. Refer to the AWS Lambda documentation for more information on how to invoke Lambda functions.

Clean Up
To clean up and remove the deployed AWS Lambda function and associated resources, follow these steps:

In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory.

Run the following command to destroy the AWS resources:

shell
Copy code
terraform destroy
Terraform will prompt for confirmation. Type yes to proceed with the destruction of resources.
